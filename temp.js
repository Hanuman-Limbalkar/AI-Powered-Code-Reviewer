❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope. This
will likely lead to errors or unexpected behavior as the function will attempt
to access variables from the global scope (if they exist) or result in
`ReferenceError` if they don't.
* ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, limiting its flexibility.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making it more
versatile and predictable.
* ✔️ By explicitly defining `a` and `b` as parameters, the function now works
correctly regardless of the global scope.

Final Note:

Always ensure that the variables used within a function are either defined
locally or passed as arguments to avoid unexpected behavior and improve code
reliability.
